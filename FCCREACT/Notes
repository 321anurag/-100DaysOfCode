ReactDom.render(<Greeting/>, document.getElementById('root'));
// must have the closing tag, if there is no closing tag.
//In render function we pass two things whatever we are going to render and where are we going to render.
render() - In render function we pass two things whatever we are going to render and where are we going to render.

>stateless functional component - also known  as dumb components, they do not have state
always have to return something [ if nothing then emty html ]

//JSX Rules
// return a single element
you can return only one single element, i.e. you cannot return two adjacen elements as:
return(
    <div>
    </div>
    <div>
    </div>
);

return(
    <div>
        <div>
            // todo
        </div>
        <div>
            // todo
        </div>
    </div>
);

// div /section/ article or Fragment

we should use proper semantics in order to make code better readable and best practice
or we can use React.Fragments also, <> </>

// className instead of class

class is a keyword so we use className to a div or other html attributes. [camelCase]

// close every element

closing tags are very important or else will give errors

// formatting
use paranthesis for safe side



Nested Components, React Tools

The idea of components is to split up your app in nice different chnks of functionality.
